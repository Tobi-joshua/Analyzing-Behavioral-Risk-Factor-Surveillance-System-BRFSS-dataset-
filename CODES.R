# The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset is a collection of public health surveys conducted from 2011 to 2015. These surveys involve data from approximately 400,000 people and aim to gather uniform, state-specific information on various health-related topics, including preventive health practices and risk behaviors associated with chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases in the adult population. Below are some key details about the dataset:
#   
#   Objective:
#   
#   The objective of the BRFSS is to collect state-specific data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive health services among U.S. residents.
# Topics Assessed:
#   
#   The factors assessed by the BRFSS include, but are not limited to:
#   Tobacco use
# Health care coverage
# HIV/AIDS knowledge or prevention
# Physical activity
# Fruit and vegetable consumption
# Data Collection Method:
#   
#   Data for this dataset are collected through telephone surveys.
# A random sample of adults (one per household) is surveyed.
# Dataset Coverage:
#   
#   The BRFSS dataset covers the years 2011 to 2015.
# It includes data from all 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories.
# Scale:
#   
#   BRFSS conducts more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it one of the largest continuously conducted health survey systems globally.
# Data Structure:
#   
#   Each year's dataset consists of several hundred columns.
# Detailed information about the dataset's columns and variables can be found in the annual code books.
# Data Format:
#   
#   The dataset is provided in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
# Note that the CSV files were converted from a SAS data format using pandas, so there may be some data artifacts as a result.
# Acknowledgments:
#   
#   This dataset was released by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
