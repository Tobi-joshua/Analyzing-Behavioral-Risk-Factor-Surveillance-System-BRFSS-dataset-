The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset is a collection of public health surveys conducted from 2011 to 2015. These surveys involve data from approximately 400,000 people and aim to gather uniform, state-specific information on various health-related topics, including preventive health practices and risk behaviors associated with chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases in the adult population. Below are some key details about the dataset:

It includes data from all 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories.
Scale:

BRFSS conducts more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it one of the largest continuously conducted health survey systems globally.
Data Structure:

Each year's dataset consists of several hundred columns.
Detailed information about the dataset's columns and variables can be found in the annual code books.
Data Format:

The dataset is provided in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
Note that the CSV files were converted from a SAS data format using pandas, so there may be some data artifacts as a result.
Acknowledgments:

This dataset was released by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
